== Description ==

Mr Block Pay Crypto plugin is powered by Aralsoft Ltd. Mr Block Pay Crypto Checkout is a cryptocurrency payment processor. You can receive customer payments direct to your crypto wallet without needing any middleware. We support TRX payments through the WooCommerce platform. This plugin is supported by woocommerce order processing functions, so it would be a smoother experience for your users as they do not have to leave your website to make payments.

The Mr Block Pay plugin converts any Fiat currency to TRX at the time of the transaction with a live exchange rate. Once payment is complete, it instantly credits the merchantâ€™s account and also provides a response to the merchant website through our API to change the order status to "processing" and to display the appropriate message to the customer.

This service relies on a 3rd party service via an API provided by Aralsoft Ltd. who are also the author of this plugin. The API is used to validate and confirm all transactions where a customer purchases a product and pays with TRX cryptocurrency using this plugin. The API service is found on the https://mrblockpay.com/ website, specifically the https://mrblockpay.com/api URL is used. The terms of use and privacy policy for this API service can be found at https://mrblockpay.com/support/content/contentid/4
